# ETL_project

For this project, I built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and a Python dictionary method to extract and transform data. After I transformed the data, I created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, I used the schema to set up Postgres database and imported the data from the CSV files.
